This site was written in Svelte and utilizes an SNES emulator compiled to WebAsembly. (a forked version of [xnes](https://github.com/tjwei/xnes), itself a modified version of [Snes9x](https://github.com/snes9xgit/snes9x), an old but popular SNES emulator.)

On page load, it fetches all the demos from the snes-demos repository, ensuring it's always up-to-date.
